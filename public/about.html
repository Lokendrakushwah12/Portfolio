        I am a passionate designer based in India with over 2 years of experience in the
        industry. My expertise lies in creating stunning anime banners and captivating Twitter headers.

        My love for anime and Japanese culture fuels my creativity, and I strive to incorporate the essence of these
        elements into every design I create. By combining my technical skills with a deep understanding of composition,
        color theory, and typography, I aim to deliver visually striking and aesthetically pleasing graphics.

        As a freelancer, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with various clients, helping them achieve their
        visual goals and establish a strong online presence. I take pride in my ability to understand each client's
        unique vision and translate it into a design that resonates with their target audience.
